APP IDEA:
I would like to build an app for my university where I will upload videos teaching data structures. In the app, there will be multiple video widgets showcasing the content, and when we click the video widget, it will take us to a new page with the video playing, a comments section, and a share button. I will use DataBase to store the videos, and I want to make this app specifically for students who want a self-paced environment.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I was little stuck when make the functionality for the button to change background color.
